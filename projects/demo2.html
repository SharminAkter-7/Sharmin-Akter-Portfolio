            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
                My mask represents how a village girl experienced the COVID-19 pandemic. In rural areas, many people were unaware of the virus’s danger and believed in false rumors instead of following safety rules. The girl continues her daily life — cooking, fishing, and talking with others — but silently faces problems like financial stress, family conflict, and loss of education due to poor internet access. Through this mask, I want to show both the lack of awareness and the emotional struggles faced by village people during the pandemic. The red and yellow halves of the face represent conflicting states of mind. The red side symbolizes anger, anxiety, and emotional pain, reflecting the turmoil caused by financial distress, domestic violence, and social instability. Meanwhile, the yellow side signifies hope, resilience, and the desire for normalcy, showing that even in darkness, the spirit of endurance persists.

            <h2>Project Justification</h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to highlight the psychological and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on village teenage girls. While urban areas received more attention and awareness, rural communities often underestimated the virus and believed in false rumors. Through this artwork, I wanted to show how a village girl’s daily life—though appearing normal—was deeply affected by financial struggles, lack of education access, and family violence. The mask symbolizes both the physical barrier against the virus and the emotional mask hiding inner pain and anxiety. By representing these issues, the project seeks to raise awareness about the neglected mental health challenges faced by rural girls during the pandemic and to encourage empathy and understanding toward their situation.

        <!-- Curriculum Integration -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <u><h2 id="mid">Mental state of a village teenage girl</h2></u>
            <h3>Curriculum Integration Theme:</h3>
            <p>
                In every semester ULAB Media Studies and Journalism Department organizes CI to focus on new ideas which can help to gather information regarding that idea and learn apart from classroom work through creative efforts. In the Summer 2020 semester, the theme was <b>“Psychology of Pandemic”</b>. The CI theme helped students show creativity through mask-making. I used this opportunity to portray the current mental state of a village teenage girl during the pandemic.
            </p>

            <h3>My Message:</h3>
            <p>
                In my mask I want to deliver a message that how a village girl face this pandemic. In this covid-19 pandemic we saw a different look in urban and rural area. We find a different look in urban and rural area during this pandemic. Village people have no fear about this virus. They believes in rumors like “village people have no risk about corona “or if they drink cow urine or black tea then the virus will not infect them.  They not even wearing mask when they go outside and not maintain social distance with others. A girl in village she spend her time normally like cooking fishing or gossiping with others. Besides they also face some problem which impact on them psychologically. According to World Health Organization they told everyone to maintain social distance, to sanitize your hand before cooking or other things but in village people did not follow this. Most of the village people work in urban area. During this pandemic many people lost their job. For this reason they are suffering from financial problem. It’s also impact a girl of village that how her family is now face this situation. Besides. They also face family violence with their family members. In this pandemic all school, collage, university are continue their classes in online method. For less device and internet problem they can't continue their classes properly. In my mask I want to convey the situation of village people that they are not serious about this corona virus but at the same time they also suffer psychological issue in this pandemic.
            </p>

            <h3>Layout:</h3>
            <p>
                I planned to make my mask into two colors. Where one side convey that they have no fear about this virus and the other side they are suffering from stress or pressure or psychological issue during this pandemic. I also put a surgical mask which is not perfectly situated in the face that convey that they don't need to wear a mask. I use some text in my mask that convey about the problem they face during this pandemic.  In background I draw some picture which portray that how they pass their time freely without any social distance or without sanitize their hand before cooking.
            </p>

            <h3>Painting & Installation:</h3>
            <p>
                The mask was painted using acrylic colors white, yellow, red and black. For the background I paint three different pictures and also gave some message that tells the problem people face in this pandemic. In the mask I put a surgical mask on the down side of the face to portray about the message easily. I tried to draw the pictures perfectly to express the message of the image which is quite difficult to me. But lastly I am happy enough that I finished my work exactly the way I thought. This project also helped me to gain new experience and also express my creativity by this mask
            </p>

            <h3>Realization:</h3>
            <p>
                At the end, I realized that I was able to express my message to those people who did not care about this pandemic via the project. It was also an enjoyable journey to learn something new. I also learn how to do something new without any help of others with my creativity. In future, if I will do this mask making I will try to plan more creative and add more message and creativity in my mask. Lastly, I am happy that I can learn some new things by this project which may help me in future.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                In every semester ci exhibition is presented in university. But in this semester we are not able to do this this exhibition physically but we show our mask presentation in online method which also a new experience for me. Overall it was a new journey for me to learn something new things by this project
            </p>

            <h3>Learnings and Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                Learnings and OutcomeThrough this project, I have learned how art can be used as a powerful medium to express social issues and emotional struggles. While researching and creating this work, I gained a deeper understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic affected people differently in rural and urban areas. I realized that awareness, education, and access to information play a vital role in how communities respond to crises.This project helped me to improve my observation, creativity, and critical thinking skills. It also taught me to visualize emotions—such as fear, loneliness, and hope—through color and composition. The outcome of this project is an artwork that communicates the hidden mental and emotional struggles of a village teenage girl during the pandemic, encouraging viewers to think about the importance of mental health, empathy, and awareness in society.
